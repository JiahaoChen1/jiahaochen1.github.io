## About Me

I'm a 3rd-year PhD student at **Renmin University of China**, where I am advised by Prof. Bing Su. I received my bachelor's and master's degrees from **Harbin Institute of Technology**. My research focuses on building more reliable and adaptable machine learning models in realistic scenarios, particularly addressing challenges in long-tailed distributions and representation learning.

## Research Interests

My research interests focus on:

* **Long-tailed Learning**: Developing methods to handle imbalanced data distributions in real-world scenarios, including uncertainty calibration, knowledge transfer, and semantic augmentation techniques.
* **Representation Learning**: Exploring effective representation learning strategies for various domains, including molecular representation learning and visual prompt tuning.
* **Foundation Models**: Investigating bias and transfer learning in foundation models, especially under long-tailed and imbalanced distributions.
* **Computer Vision Applications**: Applying advanced learning techniques to practical computer vision tasks, including image classification, molecular property prediction, and enzyme function prediction.

## Academic Service

**Conference Reviewer:** CVPR 2024, 2025 | NeurIPS 2024 | ICLR 2025 | ICML 2025 | ICCV 2025
